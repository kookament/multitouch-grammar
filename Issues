Errors in Enum class -- why are the instances themselves being autoreleased at all?

When starting a gesture, fingers may not touch down simultaneously. This causes two very close, non-moving events
to be registered at the beginning (and possibly end) of gestures, which can be a problem for canonicalizing a
gesture. In the interest of allowing tiptaps, we can't just merge adjacent nonmoving events. (Additionally, 
tiptaps are very fast...)

Possible solutions:
merge consecutive sufficiently temporally close nonmoving events into one, but only if they're at the beginning or
end of the gesture.
