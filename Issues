Errors in Enum class -- why are the instances themselves being autoreleased at all?
objc[2057]: Object 0x103001970 of class __NSCFString autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking - break on objc_autoreleaseNoPool() to debug

Collapsing swipe movements does not work as expected. A single downswipe:
    6 = "Direction.NONE";
    2 = "Direction.NONE";

    6 = "Direction.DOWN";
    2 = "Direction.NONE";

    6 = "Direction.DOWN";
    2 = "Direction.DOWN";

    6 = "Direction.DOWN";
    2 = "Direction.NONE";

    6 = "Direction.DOWN";
    2 = "Direction.DOWN";
    
Expected:
    6 = NONE
    2 = NONE
    
    6 = DOWN
    2 = DOWN

Possible causes:
    movement threshold is too hard -- if one finger is barely below the threshold but another is past it, the entire entry is clobbered,
        and the "stationary" finger is now has to move even farther (since it's relative to the new position)

Possible solutions:
    ability to bias a finger's computed direction based on the direction of the previous gesture point for that finger 
        i.e., if the finger was last registered moving down, lower the threshold for down to make consistency more likely
    don't save new points for fingers that are registered as being stationary -- if they are instead just below the threshold,
        next frame they probably will be over the threshold
    resolve adjacent points together that are really close and similar
        i.e., if a point immediately follows another point and is similar, they should actually be recorded as a single point 
            that is their combination
        problem -- what are measures of closeness (physical/temporal proximity) and similarity (NONEs are wildcards, all others must match?)
